### Running the project in a browser
1. Install NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
If you already have NodeJS, verify you have version 6 or greater by using `node -v` in your command line.

2. Install the Cordova and Ionic dependencies through your command line with `npm install -g ionic cordova`  
You may need to run `sudo npm install -g ionic cordova` or run your command prompt as administrator.

3. Clone the repository and cd into it the directory.

4. Add the browser by running `ionic platform add browser`.

5. Run the project in your browser with `ionic run browser`
Note that running in the browser does not have all of the functionality a phone would have (saving to device, selecting images etc.)
